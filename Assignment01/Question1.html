    <h1 align="center"> <u>Building the Document Structure</u></h1>
    <p> The two primary sections of an HTML document</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>HEAD</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Title tag in HEAD section gives the title to the </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3>BODY</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Whatever is written in the BODY tag appears on the
                browser window.</li>
            <li>Unordered lists can be created using the ul tag followed by li tags that list out the bulleted text.
                Li tag can have the attribute, type = circle or disc or square.</li>
            <li>Ordered lists are created using the ol tag followed by
                li tags
                that can have the attribute type = 1 or a or A or I</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <p> In addition to lists, the text can be “physically formatted” to
    appear either <b>bold </b> or italicized or <u>underlined </u> or <strike>strike through</strike> or it could also be <sub>subscripted </sub>or <sup>superscripted </sup> depending
    upon the need of the creator.</p>
    
    <p> The text can be made to appear more attractive using fonts of various styles. The <b><i> font</i></b>  
    tag does this job. The <b><i>face</i></b> <font> attribute can change the font style to whichever it is equated to.</font> The size attribute
    will change the font <b><i>size</i></b> which can range from 1 to 7. color attribute will obviously change font color if equated to
    various combinations of RGB values.</p>


    This apart if the background color has of the document has to be varied then,
    the bgColor attribute of the body tag can be set or the entire text can be aligned using the align attribute.
    Indentation with the help of the “paragraph tags” or a new line character with a line break can be achieved. Some
    special characters like copyright i.e.  or registered trademark i.e.  that are not the part of a standard keyboard
    can be inserted using the HTML character set. Apart from it, if the < &> signs are to displayed on the browser then
        corresponding character set equivalent has to be chosen. Text alignment can be either left / center / right;
        this can
        be done using the div container tag that has the align attribute. You can set the alignment accordingly. The
        power of
        net lies in its capacity to link various web pages scattered over different places on the net. The web pages can
        be
        anchored to each other using the a href tags. For instance <A HREF=http://www.anuda.com/index.html>Click here
        </A> will link to the website referenced by HREF. The user interface becomes better looking if images are
        included
        using the img tag. Its attributes src, height, width, align, border etc will produce corresponding effects.
        Images can
        be made clickable if the img tag is contained within the anchor tags as demonstrated. An image is to be inserted
        exactly at the bottom at the center position, should be square in shape with a border & should display a text
        when
        the mouse moves over it. Another clickable image that will lead to a different HTML page should also be inserted
        at
        the topmost portion of the web page, it should be wide enough to fit almost 75% of the page’s center. </p>
